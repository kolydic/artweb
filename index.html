<b>the system:</b><br>
1. freewrite to the prompt "what does it feel like to be a human in 2026?" <br>
2. displace your text with an ASCII image that reflects the writing.
<br><br>
<b>the process</b><br>
<div style="max-width: 700px;">I chose an image of a mushroom and used one of the provided image-to-ASCII conversion tools. 
    I then placed this in the file and arranged the content. 
    Finally, I used an online text-to-binary conversion tool on a stripped version of the freewriting text and styled this as a "background."
